e.g. [[Magma-Transclusion-Resolution#Optional longer descriptions]] not working

### Intra-document transclusion resolution

Intra-document tranclusions, i.e. translusions of sections inside the same document, can currently not be resolved (due to a too coarse transclusion recursion detection). However, support of such transclusions would support a very useful pattern for defining different large versions of a text. They are planned for the next version.
