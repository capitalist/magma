# ModuleDoc of Magma.Matter

## Moduledoc

Behaviour for types of matter that can be subject of a `Magma.Concept` and the `Magma.Artefact`s generated from these concepts.

This module defines a set of callbacks that each matter type must implement. These callbacks allow for the specification of various properties and behaviours of the matter type, such as the available artefacts, paths for different kinds of documents, texts for different parts of the concept and prompt documents, and more.
