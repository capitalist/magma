# `Magma.Matter.Project`

## Description

A `Magma.Matter` type behaviour implementation for the implemented and documentated project Magma is used for.

This `Magma.Matter` type is special as there's only one instance of it, since there only one project we are creating artefacts for.

This `Magma.Matter` type also plays a central role, since its description (in the `Magma.Concept` about this matter) is included (via transclusion) in every prompt.
