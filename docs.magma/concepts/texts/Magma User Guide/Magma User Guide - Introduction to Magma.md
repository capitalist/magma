# Introduction to Magma

## Description

Abstract: This section introduces the Magma project, its core technologies, and the basic idea behind it. It also explains the role of Obsidian, atomic notes and LLMs in the Magma project.

Start with an explanation of the difficulties of a simple chat interface when using LLMs for prompts in general about a complex software project and for writing longer texts to motivate and justify Magma as an IDE for project knowledge bases and prompt development. In particular:

- poor editor ...
- compositions of prompts of copy-and-pasting the same project knowledge over and over again, with the duplicated fragments becoming outdated and so on ...
- try to come up with more problems of chat interfaces in such scenarios and benefits of a system like Magma ...

It's assumed that the reader has a basic understand of what LLMs are, but not necessarily of Obsidian and atomic notes. Obsidian should be introduced properly. Atomic notes just very briefly as it will be introduced in a later section more thoroughly.

Although, it's targeted at Elixir devs in its first version (because its author used it for a software project first), the idea of prompt composition via transclusions that are resolved at prompt execution is quite powerful and makes the system useful in other use cases already, even in this first version.
